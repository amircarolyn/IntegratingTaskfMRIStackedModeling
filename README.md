Capturing Brain-Cognition Relationship: Integrating Task-BasedfMRI Across Tasks to Boost Prediction 

Capturing individual variability in cognition is a core focus of human neuroscience. However, the estimation of cognitive abilities through brain MRI remains limited in both predictive accuracy and reliability. This study investigated whether these limitations stem from an over-reliance on (1) non-task MRI modalities and (2) single rather than multiple modalities. Predictive models incorporating various MRI modalities, including task-based and non-task-based approaches, were directly compared. 

Using data from the Human Connectome Project, the study integrated task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) across seven tasks alongside other non-task MRI modalities, such as structural MRI and resting-state functional connectivity. Two multimodal MRI integration strategies—stacked and flat models—were employed, utilizing 16 combinations of machine learning algorithms. The stacked Elastic Net model, which integrated all modalities, achieved unprecedented predictive performance (r = 0.57) and excellent test-retest reliability (ICC > 0.75) in estimating general cognitive abilities. 

Notably, the model integrating tfMRI across tasks significantly outperformed the model incorporating only non-task modalities (r = 0.56 vs. r = 0.27) while maintaining excellent test-retest reliability (ICC > 0.75). This improvement was driven by regions within the frontoparietal network and by cognition-related tasks, such as working memory, relational processing, and language. These findings align with the parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence. 

Contrary to recent claims that tfMRI is unsuitable for capturing individual differences in cognition, the results suggest that tfMRI, when used comprehensively—leveraging whole-brain information across multiple tasks and integrating it with other modalities—offers a more predictive and reliable measure of cognitive abilities than non-task-based approaches.
